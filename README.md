Unit 12 homework

This homework was to scrape several websites for information about mars.

The following websites were scraped:
> https://redplanetscience.com/
> https://spaceimages-mars.com
> https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
> https://marshemispheres.com/



Then MongoDB with Flask templating was used to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped and can be updated with recent pictures and headline using a button on the webpage.
